The battery management system (BMS) monitors the current battery condition. It monitors thermal and electrical parameters and can intervene in the system to regulate it.
A thermal management system is required to conduct the waste heat from the battery during operation. This cools the battery. In case of low temperatures, heating of the battery is also possible in some cases. 
The components for heat transfer (cold plates and cooling medium) are integrated in the battery pack, while the temperature control of the medium is performed in the peripheral components.

Above a certain temperature limit (approx. 130 °C) the thermal runaway of a battery can no longer be stopped!

Graph 2.3: The battery management system (BMS) and its tasks at a glance: The BMS is an electronic system that manages the cells in a battery system. Here, the BMS acts as a control unit for monitoring and controlling the cells based on factors such as temperature, voltage and current.

The BMS monitors and controls:

•
Security and critical safety precautions

•
State-of-Charge (SOC) (0-100%)

•
State of health (SOH) -  i.e., the state of health corresponds to the maximum available storage capacity compared to the new state. At an SOH of 80% the battery has reached its end of life. 

•
Load balancing/efficiency of individual cells (balancing)

•
Compliance with operating limits

The BMS can enable improved cell utilization and efficiency and reduce the amount of battery capacity required.
Graph 2.4: Thermal management and alternative cooling concepts at a glance: The cooled medium is provided outside the battery system. The battery offers interfaces for connection. The selection of the cooling concept depends on the required cooling capacity and the amount of heat given off. Click on the +-buttons to learn more. 

Hazardous situations occur repeatedly throughout the life cycle of lithium-ion batteries worldwide. The majority of these are "thermal runaways", i.e., the thermal runaway of the battery. This generates heat, heavy metals, toxic pollutants and, last but not least, hazardous waste in the form of extinguishing water.

Battery packs for electric vehicles today consist of battery cells, battery modules and their peripheral system components. The individual lithium-ion cells are interconnected and assembled into battery modules. The modular design offers advantages in assembly, maintenance as well as scalability.

In addition to the housing and other mechanical parts, the peripheral components primarily include the battery management system (BMS) and the E/E architecture, as well as the connections for the thermal system.

Lithium-ion battery systems require continuous monitoring and control to always remain in the safe operating range. Electrical and thermal parameters are particularly critical.

The battery management system (BMS) “manages” the battery condition. It monitors thermal and electrical parameters and can intervene in the system to regulate it.
To dissipate the waste heat from the battery during operation, a thermal management system is required to cool the battery. In the case of low temperatures, heating the battery is also possible in some cases.



Above a certain temperature limit (approx. 130°C), the thermal runaway of a lithium-ion battery can no longer be stopped. This generates heat, heavy metals, toxic pollutants and, finally, hazardous waste in the form of extinguishing water.
